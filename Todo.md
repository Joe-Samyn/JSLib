- [ ] Store order of a block in the header
- [ ] HEADER_SIZE needs to be rounded up to the closed multiple of 2 for the buddy allocator
- [ ] Store entire block size in header (not just user space size)
- [ ] Ensure blocks are multiples of 2 when they are split using assert
- [ ] Always zero out headers when initializing a new chunk of memory 
- [ ] Use size_t when calculating sizes instead of int 
- [ ] Add support for user defined allocators (currently we just support global)
- [ ] Use a bitmap instead of a linked-list to store allocation status? (How to use bitmap for this?)
- [ ] Build a visualizer in Python to visual memory splitting and current allocations 
- [ ] Add threading support to allow access from multiple threads
- [ ] Add support for per thread memory pools so we don't have to lock a single pool
- [ ] We don't need to maintain pointers to links in the memory pool. Buddy allocators allow this to be calculated very easy by using the order to get the next 
block in the memory region: current block + 2^(order)
